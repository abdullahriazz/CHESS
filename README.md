# Chess Game in C++

## Overview
This project is a console-based chess game implemented in C++. It supports all the standard chess rules, including piece movements, check and checkmate detection, castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. The game is designed to be played by two players locally.

## Features
- **Piece Movements**: Implementations for all chess pieces, including King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn.
- **Special Moves**: Support for castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- **Check and Checkmate Detection**: The game checks for valid moves and detects check and checkmate conditions.
- **Turn-based Play**: The game alternates turns between two players, with each move being validated according to chess rules.

## How to Play
1. Run the program in your preferred C++ development environment.
2. Players will take turns entering their moves in the format specified by the game prompts.
3. The game will display the current state of the board after each move.
4. The game ends when one player checkmates the other.

## Setup and Compilation
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
2. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   g++ -o chess_game CHESS_FINAL.cpp

## Errors
1. Does not give checkmate.
